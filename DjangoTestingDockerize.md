- What is Docker
Docker makes development efficient and predictable. It is working in my computer, but what about after deployment to the cloud?
Docker takes away repetitive configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development.

- Build
Get a head start on your coding by leveraging Docker images to efficiently develop your own unique applications on any OS.  Create your multi-container application using Docker Compose.

- Share
Leverage Docker Trusted Content, including Docker Official Images and images from Docker Verified Publishers from the Docker Hub repository.
Innovate by collaborating with team members and other developers and by easily publishing images to Docker Hub.

- Run
Deliver multiple applications hassle free and have them run the same way on all your environments including design, testing, staging and production â€“ desktop or cloud-native.
Deploy your applications in separate containers independently and in different languages. Reduce the risk of conflict between languages, libraries or frameworks.

- Prepare Django project and push to github.

- Create Dockerfile inside working directory;
```dockerfile
# Select a base image which suits your usecase
FROM python:3.10.8-slim-bullseye

# PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 env prevents Python from copying pyc files 
# to the container. 
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

# PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 ensures that Python output is logged to 
# the terminal, making it possible to monitor Django logs in 
# realtime.
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

WORKDIR /code

COPY requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

# Adding --no-cache-dir to the pip install command saves an 
# additional disk space, as this prevents pip from caching 
# downloads and caching wheels locally. Since you won't need 
# to install requirements again after the Docker image has 
# been created, this can be added to the pip install command.
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir

COPY . /code/

CMD [ "python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000" ]
```

- Build image using Dockerfile on the current directory;
```docker
docker build -t django-testing .
```

- Make a container from the image you just created with the tag `django-testing`;
```docker
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 django-testing
```

- Go to the Docker Desktop and open your app on the browser. Also you can simply go to the endpoint you published on your docker run command which is port 8000.

- See your application up and running. But if you test the app you will see you did not apply migrations and create db tables. So open a terminal and migrate db tables.
